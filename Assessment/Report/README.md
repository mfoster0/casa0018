# Counting Crows


## Introduction
The project was to create a deep learning model to detect species of birds by their calls

## Data
All data is stored in this repo. It's split beteen 2 zips for github restrictions

## Model
Edge Impulse MFE was used to create the final model with incredible scores >98% on the training data, only dropping to 95% intesting


## Experiments
Around 50 experiments we performed. All captured in the Excel Experiments sheet with the params used and screen shots


## Results and Observations
Data preparation is difficult and timeconsuming. On reflection I would have used long windows that 800ms and used the intended deployment device to record the data.

Edge Impulse is so powerful and would be my go-to tool for this type of model

## Refs
I used Edge Impulse tutorials

I used myown data and supplemented with Xeno Canto data download via python script stored with the code
